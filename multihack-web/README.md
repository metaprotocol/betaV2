## Introducting Version 4.0!

- Multihack now uses a [Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) to merge conflicts and ensure everyone is always looking at the same code. Thanks @kifhan for assistance with this!

- You can now see your team's carets, and the notifications are less instrusive. Thanks to @Worie!
